			<title>Project</title>
			<p>The Simetron Project is an open source project, sponsored by The Olympum Software Group, that aims at creating a modular traffic simulator for metropolitan networks.</p>

			<p>Simetron is designed as an open plugin architecture, written in C#, with multi-platform support via the <fork href="http://www.go-mono.com/">mono runtime</fork>. Simetron consists of the following modules:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Workbench - A graphical user interface for monitoring and controlling simulations, analyzing results, and editing networks. [Started]</li>
				<li>Microkernel - The small footprint simulation engine based on a distributed workflow engine. [Started]</li>
				<li>Supply Simulator. [Not Started]</li>
				<li>Demand Simulator. [Not Started]</li>
				<li>TMC Simulator. [Not Started]</li>
				<li>ATIS/ATMS Simulator.[Not Started]</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The Simetron Project is hosted by <fork href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/simetron">berliOS</fork>, a free service to Open Source developers offering easy access to the best in CVS, mailing lists, bug tracking, message boards/forums, task management, site hosting, permanent file archival, full backups, and total web-based administration.</p>

			<title>Subprojects</title>								
			<p>During the development of Simetron we continously face technical problems, for which we create libraries with no dependencies with Simetron, the simulator. You can use these in your project.</p>
			<ul> 
	 			<li><link href="./subprojects/gtkgl-sharp.html">GtkGL#</link> - A C# library that integrates <fork href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</fork> with the <fork href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk# windowing toolkit.</fork></li>
				<li>PVM.NET - C# bindings for <fork href="http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html">PVM</fork>.</li>
				<li>JMS.NET - A JMS provider/bridge for .NET.</li>
				<li>Cibeles - An embedded workflow engine.</li>
			</ul>
